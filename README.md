# (Draft) Internal economy model for software communities

## Abstract

Software communities, regardless of the targetted language, are overall very similar and implement the same mechanisms to survive:
* Organise local and/or global events
* Keep members informed of what happens
* Attract new members
* Filter job offers/recruiting requests

Most of them, when not lead by companies, stay afloat thanks to the generosity of some of its members that invest time in the above activities.

It usually works well and that's the least you expect from a software community. To have information and events around the stack they advocate. There are however, behaviors that are sometimes hard to enforce in most software communities:
* Experienced members helping juniors get there through thorough and durable help and follow-up
* Members being less passive and giving at least as much as they receive
* More organic organisation instead of always relying on the same core team/person

Those behaviors could be enforced using basic gamification techniques, such as internal economy with virtual currency.

## Virtual currency

Virtual currency is a way to exchange goods and services with a currency that can only be used within a specific context. Virtual currencies are used a lot in video games, and sometimes they give you the possibility to exchange virtual money with real world money, following a change rate.

A variant of Virtual currency is local currencies you can find if some areas of the world to enforce the exchange of goods and services from a specific area.

## Virtual currency in a software community

We want members to interract more and exchange goods and services. The community organisation acts as a marketplace as well as a bank.

### How does it work

Let's say the software community gives 5 virtual dollars to any of it's contributing members at the beginning of a year. Those vdollars can be exchanged for goods and services. Any member can propose goods and services within the community. Let's say that for a participation in the organisation of 20$ a year, I receive 5 vdollars.

**Events**

Some events in software communities may require a small participation fee, that can be paid in vdollars. Vdollars can also be used to get discounts to the local conference or bigger events. Vdollars could also be used to pay for drinks during free events.

**Goods**

You can exchange vdollars for a t-shirt, a mug, or any goodies the community might have available. Goods can also be members proposing some personal items in exchange for vdollars.

**Services**

You can pay for services proposed by other members of the community with vdollars. Coaching sessions, code reviews, one-to-one discussions etc...

**How to earn vdollars**

* You can make a donation to the organisation and it will reward you with a proportional amount of vdollars to use in the local economy. This can provide a way to the community to raise little amounts of money to finance more events.
* You can offer some of your time in exchange for vdollars. For instance, 1 hour of code review + 1 hour of one-to-one disscusion for 10 vdollars.
* Someone can donate you vdollars. If I see you have contributed a lot to the community or helped me, or built something I use and find usefull, I can donate vdollars as a "tip" to thank you.

**Keep track of transactions**

The community should provide a virtual account where members can make transactions with other members. Where members can propose goods and services.

It is also important that the organisation keeps a decent amount of vdollars in its control to make sure it has a decent virtual cashflow. Each time a new member grows the community, more vdollars are created.
